# Food-Desert-Analysis-in-Urban-Areas
## This project focuses on analyzing food deserts in urban areas, specifically within the state of Illinois, using geospatial data. Food deserts are regions where residents have limited access to affordable, nutritious food, which can significantly impact public health.
## The analysis is conducted using data on food retail locations, public health outcomes (e.g., obesity and diabetes rates), demographic factors like income and household size, and transportation infrastructure such as public transit routes.
